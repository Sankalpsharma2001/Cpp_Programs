          string::npos in C++

It is a constant static member value with the highest possible value for an element of type size_t.
It actually means until the end of the string.
It is used as the value for a length parameter in the stringâ€™s member functions.
As a return value, it is usually used to indicate no matches.

string:npos constant is defined with a value of -1, because size_t is an unsigned integral type, and -1 is the largest possible representable value for this type.
example
 
 s=geeksforgeeks  s1=for
 int f=s.find(s1) // f gives 5 index where we find 
  if(f!=string::npos) //found  // Check if position is -1 or not

  // Check IF string is rotation of each other or not first we merge one string s1=s1+s1 then find s2 in s1 if //found then true
